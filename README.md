# .dotfiles
This repo is where I keep my config files and instructions to install them.
I am using Manjaro-i3 as my operating system. Take note that some of these configs 
like i3 might be specific to my OS, while others can be applied to other OSs, as well (Windows users should use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)).
